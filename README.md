# dayPlanner

## Description 

> During this assignment, I created a day planner that allows the user to insert a "to-do" list that will get saved to the local storage. To start the user off, there is a button made available to be clicked, once clicked a quote will be displayed. The user can click the button and will be presented with over 20 different quotes relative to "managing time, and the importance thereof". The day planner responds to real time - the color of the time slots will depend on the time that is reflecting. It is broken up into 3 different criteria (past, present, future). When the time has past the color changes green to red, when the time is present and still within reason the color will change from green to orange, finally future time will be indicated as green. The user will write out their plans, or activity that needs to be completed within the time and click "Save", doing so SAVES the information into the local storage.

 Considering it is designed for a "work day" the time reflects from 9 A.M - 5 P.M.
